## Description üì∞
GD ATMs
Welcome to GD ATMs! Established in 2021 by Peyton Touma, GD ATMs was born from an idea that sparked during a trip to Las Vegas. While visiting his sister, a student at UNLV, Peyton noticed that all the casinos had ATMs with high withdrawal fees and wondered where these fees were going. After about a year of dedicated research and development, GD ATMs was launched with a mission to transform the ATM experience.

From home, the user can navigate to use many features. Firstly, they are greeted with a slideshow, which describes Liber. Additionally, in the navigation bar, the user can view all books and search books. From there, home features all the books from our database, limited to 5 books per page. Under that hosts a Spotlight Read that features the most engaged-with book.
